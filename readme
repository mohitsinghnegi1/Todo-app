## description

- The objective of this assessment is to determine your strengths and weaknesses in different
  areas.

- You will need to set up a ReactJS project and deploy it to any platform
- This project will contain one page only.

- This page will have two tabs as shown below, “To Do” and “To Read”
- All of the cards for those two tabs should come from two different JSON files (one for each
  tab)
- The structure of the JSON you can decide, but all text and images like “Hair Appointment”,
  “with Dr. Shobita”, “Today, 3:30PM” and the icon must come from the JSON.
- On swipe left on the “to do” items, a button should appear which
  console.log(id + ‘: completed’)
  on click. The complete should also be triggered if the card is swiped far to the left.
